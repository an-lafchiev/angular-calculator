            Sure, you could use your phone's calculator. But can your phone's calculator demonstrate
            mastery of Angular Components, Services, and Router? No? That's what I thought.
        </p>

        <p>
            This calculator does the math basics—addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
            Built with Angular 19 and Signals because we're fancy like that. Every pixel styled with
            custom CSS, zero CSS libraries invited to this party.
        </p>

        <p>
            Is routing overkill for a calculator? Absolutely. Did we do it anyway to flex our
            Angular skills? You bet.
